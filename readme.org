#+title: Game of Life

This is a project where I attempt to use different approach to build
the Conway's game of life.

This is mainly for a test of my target based learning.

* Note
There will be a note.org in each subdirectory describing problems and
solutions.

Potential problems should be listed as TODO, if the problem is solved,
mark it as DONE.

For each solved problem, create an org-roam note.
